Lichfield Cathedral, in Lichfield, Staffordshire, is the only medieval English cathedral with three spires. The cathedral suffered severe damage during the English Civil War in which all of the stained glass was destroyed. In spite of this, the windows of the Lady Chapel contain some of the finest medieval Flemish painted glass in existence. Dating from the 1530s, it came from Herkenrode Abbey in Belgium, in 1801, having been purchased by Sir Brooke Boothby when that abbey was dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars. It was sold on to the cathedral for the same price. There are also some fine windows by Betton and Evans (1819), and many fine late-19th-century windows, particularly those by Charles Eamer Kempe.
